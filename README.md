# Xplore
In a nutshell, **Xplore** is a context menu based **file explorer** designed to enhance producitity by making it possible to browse files and folders using a dynamic, standlone context menu system.

**Xplore** run in the system tray (notification area), and it restores the Quick Launch toolbar feature from Windows 10 and earlier versions, specifically for file system navigation. Microsoft removed the Quick Launch toolbar in Windows 11, but Xplore brings it back, allowing you to browse your files and folders effortlessly through a dynamically expanding context menu. It makes opening a specific folder quick and easy, eliminating the extra clicks or double-clicks that would have otherwise been required to navigate to that specific folder or file in Windows Explorer.

## Features

- **Quick Access to Drives** – Clicking the system tray icon opens a menu displaying all available drives.  
- **Dynamic Navigation** – Expand folders within the menu to browse files and subfolders without opening File Explorer.  
- **Single Click to Open Files** – Open files directly with a single click.  
- **Double Click to Open Folders** – Open a folder with a double-click.  
- **Minimal & Lightweight** – Runs in the system tray without cluttering your desktop.
- **Global shortcut Win+Shift+A** - to launch this expanding file system menu from anywhere even when you're working on other apps. 

## Why Xplore?

Windows 10 allowed users to pin "This PC" (My Computer) to the taskbar as a quicklaunch item and access file system contents via expandable menu. Windows 11 removed this functionality. **Xplore restores this experience**, letting you browse your entire file system seamlessly through the system tray.
