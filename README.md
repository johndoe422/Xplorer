# Xplore

**Xplore** is a lightweight system tray application that restores the **Quick Launch "My Computer" expanding filesystem menu** from Windows 10 and earlier versions. Microsoft removed the quicklanch toolbar in Windows 11, but Xplore brings it back for specifically for the file system, allowing you to navigate your file system effortlessly through a dynamically expanding context menu.

## Features

- **Quick Access to Drives** – Clicking the system tray icon opens a menu displaying all available drives.  
- **Dynamic Navigation** – Expand folders within the menu to browse files and subfolders without opening File Explorer.  
- **Single Click to Open Files** – Open files directly with a single click.  
- **Double Click to Open Folders** – Open a folder with a double-click.  
- **Minimal & Lightweight** – Runs in the system tray without cluttering your desktop.  

## Why Xplore?

Windows 10 allowed users to pin "This PC" (My Computer) to the taskbar as a quicklaunch item and access file system contents via expandable menu. Windows 11 removed this functionality. **Xplore restores this experience**, letting you browse your entire file system seamlessly through the system tray.
