# Xplore

**Xplore** is a lightweight system tray application that restores the **Quick Launch "My Computer" expanding filesystem menu** from Windows 10 and earlier versions. Microsoft removed the ability to add such a quicklanch of the file system in Windows 11, but Xplore brings it back, allowing you to navigate your file system effortlessly through a dynamically expanding context menu.

## Features

- **Quick Access to Drives** – Clicking the system tray icon opens a menu displaying all available drives.  
- **Dynamic Navigation** – Expand folders within the menu to browse files and subfolders without opening File Explorer.  
- **Single Click to Open Files** – Open files directly with a single click.  
- **Double Click to Open Folders** – Open a folder with a double-click.  
- **Minimal & Lightweight** – Runs in the system tray without cluttering your desktop.  

## Why Xplore?

Windows 10 allowed users to pin "This PC" (My Computer) to the taskbar as a quicklaunch item and access file system contents via expandable menu. Windows 11 removed this functionality. **Xplore restores this experience**, letting you browse your entire file system seamlessly through the system tray.
